## Problem Description

Write a program to solve a Sudoku puzzle by filling the empty cells.

A sudoku solution must satisfy all of the following rules:

1. Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each row.
2. Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each column.
3. Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each of the 9 $3 \times 3$ sub-boxes of the grid.

The '.' character indicates empty cells.

### Examples

#### Example 1:

**Input**: board =

```
[["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
```

**Output**:

```
[["5","3","4","6","7","8","9","1","2"],["6","7","2","1","9","5","3","4","8"],["1","9","8","3","4","2","5","6","7"],["8","5","9","7","6","1","4","2","3"],["4","2","6","8","5","3","7","9","1"],["7","1","3","9","2","4","8","5","6"],["9","6","1","5","3","7","2","8","4"],["2","8","7","4","1","9","6","3","5"],["3","4","5","2","8","6","1","7","9"]]
```

**Explanation**: The input board is shown above and the only valid solution is shown below:

### Constraints

- board.length == 9
- board[i].length == 9
- board[i][j] is a digit 1-9 or '.'.
- It is guaranteed that the input board has only one solution.

### Approach

ðŸ‘‰ Iterate Through Each Cell: The algorithm iterates through each cell of the Sudoku board

ðŸ‘‰ Empty Cell Check: If the current cell is empty (contains â€˜.â€™), the algorithm proceeds to try different numbers (from â€˜1â€™ to â€˜9â€™) in that cell

ðŸ‘‰ Number Placement: For each number, the algorithm checks if placing that number in the current cell is valid according to the Sudoku rules (no repetition in the same row, column, or $3 \times 3$ sub-box).

ðŸ‘‰ Recursive Exploration: If placing a number is valid, the algorithm sets that number in the cell and recursively explores the next empty cell.

ðŸ‘‰ Backtracking: If the recursive exploration leads to an invalid solution, the algorithm backtracks by undoing the choice (resetting the cell to â€˜.â€™) and trying the next number.

ðŸ‘‰ Solution Check: The algorithm continues exploring possibilities until a valid solution is found, or it exhaustively searches all possibilities.

### Solution Code

#### Python

```
class Solution:
  def solveSudoku(self, board: List[List[str]]) -> None:
    def isValid(row: int, col: int, c: str) -> bool:
      for i in range(9):
        if board[i][col] == c or \
           board[row][i] == c or \
           board[3 * (row // 3) + i // 3][3 * (col // 3) + i % 3] == c:
          return False
      return True

    def solve(s: int) -> bool:
      if s == 81:
        return True

      i = s // 9
      j = s % 9

      if board[i][j] != '.':
        return solve(s + 1)

      for c in string.digits[1:]:
        if isValid(i, j, c):
          board[i][j] = c
          if solve(s + 1):
            return True
          board[i][j] = '.'

      return False

    solve(0)

```

### Conclusion

âœ… Time Complexity:

âœ” The solve method uses a backtracking approach to explore the solution space.

âœ” In the worst case, the algorithm tries out all possibilities for each empty cell until a valid solution is found or all possibilities are exhausted.

âœ” The time complexity of the backtracking algorithm is typically exponential, but in practice, it tends to be much less than the worst case.

âœ” The algorithm explores 9 possibilities for each of the 81 cells, resulting in a time complexity of $O(9^m)$, where m represents the number of empty cells.

âœ… Space Complexity:

âœ” The algorithm uses a recursive approach to explore the solution space.

âœ” The recursive stack depth is proportional to the number of empty cells in the Sudoku board.

âœ” The space complexity of the backtracking algorithm is typically linear, but in practice, it tends to be much less.

âœ” The algorithm explores 9 possibilities for each of the 81 cells, resulting in a space complexity of $O(m)$, where m represents the number of empty cells.

âœ… The algorithm solves the Sudoku puzzle by backtracking through the solution space, exploring possibilities until a valid solution is found or all possibilities are exhausted.

âœ… The algorithm uses a recursive approach to explore the solution space, setting numbers in empty cells and checking if the placement is valid according to the Sudoku rules.

âœ… The algorithm backtracks when an invalid solution is found, undoing the choice and trying the next number.
