Django is a high-level Python web framework that allows developers to create robust web applications quickly. It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, but in Django's case, it's more accurately described as Model-View-Template (MVT). Here's a breakdown of some key concepts and explanations you'll encounter when learning Django:

1. **Models**: Models in Django are Python classes that define the structure of your data. Each model class corresponds to a database table, and attributes of the class represent fields of the table. Django provides an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) layer that lets you interact with your database using Python code, without writing SQL queries directly.

2. **Views**: Views are Python functions or classes that receive web requests and return web responses. They contain the business logic of your application and determine what content is displayed to the user. Views typically interact with models to retrieve data and templates to render HTML.

3. **Templates**: Templates are HTML files that contain the presentation layer of your application. They are used to generate dynamic HTML content by combining static HTML with Django template language (DTL). Templates can include variables, tags, and filters provided by DTL to render data passed from views.

4. **URL Dispatcher**: Django uses a URL dispatcher to map URL patterns to views. It allows you to define URL patterns in a central location (usually in `urls.py` files) and specify which view function or class should handle each pattern.

5. **Admin Interface**: Django provides a built-in admin interface that allows administrators to manage site content without writing any views or templates. It's automatically generated from your models and can be extensively customized to suit your application's needs.

6. **Forms**: Django forms allow you to create HTML forms that can validate user input and handle form submission. They simplify the process of collecting and processing user data, and they can be used in views to create, update, or delete objects in the database.

7. **Middleware**: Middleware is a framework of hooks into Django’s request/response processing. It’s a lightweight, low-level plugin system for globally altering Django’s input or output.

8. **Sessions and Authentication**: Django provides built-in support for user authentication, sessions, and authorization. It includes a flexible authentication system that allows you to manage user accounts and permissions easily.

9. **Static files**: Django allows you to manage static files (e.g., CSS, JavaScript, images) using its built-in `staticfiles` app. It provides tools to collect, store, and serve static files during development and deployment.

10. **Settings**: Django settings are configuration parameters that control the behavior of your Django application. Settings are typically stored in a `settings.py` file and include things like database configuration, static files settings, middleware configuration, etc.
